// Wrap everything we're about to do in a document ready function

	// Cache our jQuery element selectors. We'll need:
	// * The todo list
	// * The addform input
	// * The addform form element

	// First we should add the ability to click on list items to cross them out.
	// Clicking on a list item should add the "crossed" class to it. Remember to
	// use a child selector with the event, because we'll be adding todos later.

		// You can grab the todo we clicked by using the event object

	// Next, we'll want to bind to the form's submit event. When the form is
	// submitted, we'll want to add a new todo. Don't forget to prevent default
	// the event, or it'll refresh the page!

		// Grab the text from the input element using the `val()` function, and make
		// a new todo element with that text. Alert the user of an error if they
		// entered no text.

		// Insert the new element in the todo list

		// Don't forget to clear out the value of the input! Hint: if we can get
		// html using html(), and set it using html(string), maybe val() works
		// in a similar way? Read the docs!



// And that's it! You're done! Got some free time? Try some of the BONUS tasks
// below to further enhance your application.

// BONUS: Convert all of your code in to a TodoApp singleton. Split out what it
// does in to separate functions.

// BONUS: Toggle the crossed class instead of adding it, to allow for
// uncrossing of list items.

// BONUS: Add shift-clicking to remove todos. Check the event object and see
// if there's something that tells us what keys they're holding?

// BONUS: Don't allow them to add the same todo twice, warn them if they try to

// BONUS: Make the title editable without having to change the HTML file
